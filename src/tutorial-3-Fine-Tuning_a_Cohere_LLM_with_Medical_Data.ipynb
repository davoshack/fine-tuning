    "Using a proprietary model simplifies the fine-tuning process by simply supplying sample inputs and outputs, with the platform managing the actual fine-tuning. For example, in a classification model, a typical input would be a pair of <text, label>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cohere offers a range of specialized models for specific use cases and different functions, including  [rerank](https://txt.cohere.com/rerank/),  [embedding](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/multilingual-language-models), and  [chat](https://cohere.com/chat), all accessible via APIs. Users can create  [custom models](https://txt.cohere.com/custom-command-models/)  for three primary objectives: 1) Generative tasks where the model produces text output, 2) Classification tasks where the model categorizes text, and 3) Rerank tasks to improve semantic search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are fine-tuning a proprietary LLM developed by  [Cohere](https://cohere.com/)  for medical text analysis to perform  [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition). NER enables models to recognize multiple entities in text, such as names, locations, and dates. We will fine-tune a model to extract information about diseases, substances, and their interactions from medical paper abstracts."

    "Progressive neurodegeneration of the optic nerve and the loss of retinal ganglion cells is a hallmark of glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) being the most frequent form of glaucoma in the Western world. While some genetic mutations have been identified for some glaucomas, those associated with POAG are limited and for most POAG patients, the etiology is still unclear. Unfortunately, treatment of this neurodegenerative disease and other retinal degenerative diseases is lacking. For POAG, most of the treatments focus on reducing aqueous humor formation, enhancing uveoscleral or conventional outflow, or lowering intraocular pressure through surgical means. These efforts, in some cases, do not always lead to a prevention of vision loss and therefore other strategies are needed to reduce or reverse the progressive neurodegeneration. In this review, we will highlight some of the ocular pharmacological approaches that are being tested to reduce neurodegeneration and provide some form of neuroprotection.\n",
