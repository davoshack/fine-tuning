    "Cohere offers a range of specialized models for specific use cases and different functions, including  [rerank](https://txt.cohere.com/rerank/),  [embedding](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/multilingual-language-models), and  [chat](https://cohere.com/chat), all accessible via APIs. Users can create  [custom models](https://txt.cohere.com/custom-command-models/)  for three primary objectives: 1) Generative tasks where the model produces text output, 2) Classification tasks where the model categorizes text, and 3) Rerank tasks to improve semantic search results.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we are fine-tuning a proprietary LLM developed by  [Cohere](https://cohere.com/)  for medical text analysis to perform  [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition). NER enables models to recognize multiple entities in text, such as names, locations, and dates. We will fine-tune a model to extract information about diseases, substances, and their interactions from medical paper abstracts."

    "Progressive neurodegeneration of the optic nerve and the loss of retinal ganglion cells is a hallmark of glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) being the most frequent form of glaucoma in the Western world. While some genetic mutations have been identified for some glaucomas, those associated with POAG are limited and for most POAG patients, the etiology is still unclear. Unfortunately, treatment of this neurodegenerative disease and other retinal degenerative diseases is lacking. For POAG, most of the treatments focus on reducing aqueous humor formation, enhancing uveoscleral or conventional outflow, or lowering intraocular pressure through surgical means. These efforts, in some cases, do not always lead to a prevention of vision loss and therefore other strategies are needed to reduce or reverse the progressive neurodegeneration. In this review, we will highlight some of the ocular pharmacological approaches that are being tested to reduce neurodegeneration and provide some form of neuroprotection.\n",

The hypotensive effect of 100 mg/kg alpha-methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone. Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate. In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-naloxone (8 nM), and naloxone, 10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence clonidine-suppressible binding of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (1 nM). These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors. As naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site, the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha-methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone.',  \n",
