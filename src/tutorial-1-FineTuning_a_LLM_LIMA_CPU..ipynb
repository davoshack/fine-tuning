    "# Tutorial 1: SFT with LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "• Find the  [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/towardsai/ragbook-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Chapter%2010%20-%20FineTuning_a_LLM_LIMA_CPU.ipynb)  for this section at  [towardsai.net/book](http://towardsai.net/book).\n",
    "\n",
    "The upcoming section will demonstrate an example of fine-tuning a model using the LoRA approach on a small dataset. This technique allows for instruction tuning of large language models by applying low-rank adaptations to modify the model’s behavior without retraining its weights. This process is highly efficient and can be executed using a CPU on a Google Cloud instance. We will guide you through preparing the dataset and conducting the fine-tuning process using the Hugging Face library. This hands-on example will provide a practical understanding of enhancing model performance with minimal computational resources and dataset size.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Hugging Face library is used in this example, the following libraries provide a range of tools, optimizations, compatibility with various data types, resource efficiency, and user-friendly interfaces to support different tasks and hardware setups, enhancing the efficiency of the LLM fine-tuning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [PEFT Library](https://github.com/huggingface/peft): The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) library enables the efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model’s parameters. Methods like LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and P-tuning are part of PEFT.\n",
    "-   [Lit-GPT](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt): Developed by LightningAI, Lit-GPT is also an open-source tool designed to streamline fine-tuning. It facilitates the application of techniques like LoRA without manual modifications to the core model architecture. Models such as  [Vicuna](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/),  [Pythia](https://www.eleuther.ai/papers-blog/pythia-a-suite-for-analyzing-large-language-modelsacross-training-and-scaling), and  [Falcon](https://falconllm.tii.ae/)  are available. Lit-GPT allows applying specific configurations to different weight matrices and offers adjustable precision settings to manage memory usage effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also recommend using virtual machines on systems like GCP, which is good practice in the industry and might be better than using your current system in most cases. To do so, log in to the Google Cloud Platform account and create a  [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)  instance. You can select from various  [machine types](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms). Cloud GPUs are a popular option for many deep learning applications, but CPUs can also effectively optimize LLMs. For this example, we train the model using a CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever type of machine you choose to use, if you encounter an out-of-memory error, try reducing parameters such as `batch_size or seq_length`.\n",
    "\n",
    ">⚠️**Note:**  Costs are associated with starting up virtual machines. The total cost will depend on the type of machine and how long it is running. Regularly check your costs in the billing section of GCP and turn off your virtual machines when you’re not using them.\n",
    "\n",
    ">💡If you want to run the code in the section without spending much money, you can perform a few iterations of training on your virtual machine and then stop it."

    "    Question: Write a recipe with chicken.\\n\\n Answer: \\n* Chicken and rice is one of the most popular meals in China, especially during Chinese New Year celebrations when it's served as an appetizer or main course for dinner parties (or just to eat by yourself). It can be made from scratch using fresh ingredients like meatballs/chicken breasts if you have them on hand but otherwise use frozen ones that are already cooked so they don't need any additional cooking time before serving. You could also substitute some vegetables instead such as broccoli florets which would make this dish even more delicious! If your family doesn’t know how to cook well then I suggest making these recipes ahead of time because once done all you really do is reheat until hot again :)\\n## Make homemade marinade\\n1) Combine 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 2 tablespoons sesame oil, 3 teaspoons sugar, 4 cloves garlic minced into small pieces, 6-8 green onions chopped finely, 5 cups water, salt & pepper to taste, about 8 ounces boneless skinless chicken breast fillets cut up fine enough not to stick together while being mixed thoroughly - no bones needed here since there will only ever be two servings per person), ½ cup cornstarch dissolved in ¼..."

This will help you get more sales as will since people are less likely to visit brick & mortar shops if they have no way to buy what is being sold there in person!

    "    \"</s>Question: Why does it rain? Explain your answer.\\n\\n Answer: The moon’s gravity is a lot less than earths and so the sky never really gets dark, but rather stays mostly clear (which makes things easier because it can be difficult to see stars from below). Even when there are clouds in sight of another planet like Mars or Jupiter then you will still have plenty if light on that other planets surface regardless due to its size relative star density.\\nWhy do cows breathe air too though!? My Knowledge might be off base here…..but seriously why??? Is this how animals die…by suffocation?? Would an animal take such risks without having been programmed with those behaviours for survival?!

Explain your answer.\\n\\n Answer: \\n* The Earth\\'s atmosphere is a giant, complex system that has many different layers and processes at work to keep the planet wet (and dry). Rain falls on land because of gravity waves from other planets in our solar system or even distant galaxies; these gravitational forces are so strong they can push water molecules into clouds where precipitation occurs. Water droplets then fall as snowflakes onto surfaces like mountains, which act much more slowly than air currents do but still move enough for them all to be frozen solid before falling back down again when spring arrives. This process repeats itself over time until there isn\\'t any moisture left anywhere except under ice sheets covering Antarctica. When this happens, we call winter “the end”-— no longer will you see anything growing outside during summer months!

    "    \"</s>Question: What's the Italian translation of the word \\'house\\'?.\\n\\n Answer: \\n* \"House\" is a noun, which means an enclosed space or building in English (and other languages). The verb form for house can be either singular (\"I live at home\") and plural (*) (\"We have houses\"), but it usually refers to one person living there alone; e.g., I am my own landlord because we don\\'t share any property with eachother. In some cases you may also see * (noun), like when someone says they are their parents\\' only child - that would mean both parentage as well as residence together on this planet! For example, if your mother lives next door while her father works out-of town all day long she could say something along these lines about herself being his sole tenant/owner without having to specify who owns what piece of real estate between them...\\nIn general though, people tend not to use words such as apartment / flat etc.; instead using terms more commonly used by Americans including single family homes & multi unit dwellings.

    "The results show the limitations and strengths of both models. The LoRA-tuned model generates more coherent, structured responses compared to the vanilla model, which often provides irrelevant answers. The LoRA model tends to follow the prompt more accurately, offering step-by-step guidance (e.g., creating a marketing plan) and correct interpretations (e.g., the Italian translation of “house”). However, it occasionally adds extraneous or overly detailed information, making responses verbose. The vanilla model, while shorter, often lacks relevance and logical flow, producing confusing responses making it less reliable. Overall, the LoRA model delivers more usable and intelligible answers. This improvement would likely be more significant with fine-tuning larger LLMs."
