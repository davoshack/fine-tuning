    "# Tutorial 1: SFT with LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "• Find the  [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/towardsai/ragbook-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Chapter%2010%20-%20FineTuning_a_LLM_LIMA_CPU.ipynb)  for this section at  [towardsai.net/book](http://towardsai.net/book).\n",
    "\n",
    "The upcoming section will demonstrate an example of fine-tuning a model using the LoRA approach on a small dataset. This technique allows for instruction tuning of large language models by applying low-rank adaptations to modify the model’s behavior without retraining its weights. This process is highly efficient and can be executed using a CPU on a Google Cloud instance. We will guide you through preparing the dataset and conducting the fine-tuning process using the Hugging Face library. This hands-on example will provide a practical understanding of enhancing model performance with minimal computational resources and dataset size.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Hugging Face library is used in this example, the following libraries provide a range of tools, optimizations, compatibility with various data types, resource efficiency, and user-friendly interfaces to support different tasks and hardware setups, enhancing the efficiency of the LLM fine-tuning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [PEFT Library](https://github.com/huggingface/peft): The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) library enables the efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model’s parameters. Methods like LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and P-tuning are part of PEFT.\n",
    "-   [Lit-GPT](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt): Developed by LightningAI, Lit-GPT is also an open-source tool designed to streamline fine-tuning. It facilitates the application of techniques like LoRA without manual modifications to the core model architecture. Models such as  [Vicuna](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/),  [Pythia](https://www.eleuther.ai/papers-blog/pythia-a-suite-for-analyzing-large-language-modelsacross-training-and-scaling), and  [Falcon](https://falconllm.tii.ae/)  are available. Lit-GPT allows applying specific configurations to different weight matrices and offers adjustable precision settings to manage memory usage effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also recommend using virtual machines on systems like GCP, which is good practice in the industry and might be better than using your current system in most cases. To do so, log in to the Google Cloud Platform account and create a  [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute)  instance. You can select from various  [machine types](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/cpu-platforms). Cloud GPUs are a popular option for many deep learning applications, but CPUs can also effectively optimize LLMs. For this example, we train the model using a CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever type of machine you choose to use, if you encounter an out-of-memory error, try reducing parameters such as `batch_size or seq_length`.\n",
    "\n",
    ">⚠️**Note:**  Costs are associated with starting up virtual machines. The total cost will depend on the type of machine and how long it is running. Regularly check your costs in the billing section of GCP and turn off your virtual machines when you’re not using them.\n",
    "\n",
    ">💡If you want to run the code in the section without spending much money, you can perform a few iterations of training on your virtual machine and then stop it."
